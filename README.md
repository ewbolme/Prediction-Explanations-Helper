# Prediction Explanation Helper Pipeline

This repo contains code designed to help users interact prediction explanations in the datarobot API. The overall design is that the main class stores the data in a pipleine and performs actions on this data inplace. As such everything reolves around a class titled <code>DR_Pred_Explan_Pipeline</code> in **dr_api_request.py** which contains a rather large number of class methods which perform all of the needed processing
